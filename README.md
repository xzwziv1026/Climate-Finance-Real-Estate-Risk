This repository contains data and analysis for evaluating the impact of climate risk on real estate investments in major U.S. cities from 2015 to 2023.

## Dataset Overview

- **Years**: 2015–2023
- **Variables**:
  - `Base Price`: Initial property price before climate risk adjustments
  - `Climate Risk Score`: A risk factor between 0.2 and 0.8, where higher values indicate greater exposure
  - `Green Bond Financed`: Whether the property was financed through a green bond (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
